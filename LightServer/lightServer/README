This is a C++20 makefile project [DESIGNED FOR UNIX SYSTEMS ON A UNIX SYSTEM].
    switch.cpp is the C++ part of the program which must be compiled first
    start.sh will compile and launch the C++ code along with TCPDUMP at the same time

NOTE: Couldn't get flag implementation to work, so please use arguments as shown below

NOTE2: Please create a file that is the name of your logfile supplied to the program. The program
    will look for a file by that name and exit if none found.
