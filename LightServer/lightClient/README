g++


This is a C++20 makefile project [DESIGNED FOR UNIX SYSTEMS ON A UNIX SYSTEM].
    This will compile switch.cpp which is the C++ part of this program
    client.sh will compile and launch the C++ code along with TCPDUMP
   

NOTE: user may have to use sudo chmod u+x client.sh
NOTE2: Please create a file that is the name of your logfile supplied to the program. The program
    will look for a file by that name.

How to use:

Had to deviate from project specifications slightly as I could not figure out how to get my implementation of flags to work correctly, therefore use is:
./client.sh <Server IP> <PORT> <LOGFILE NAME>


In Short steps to run w/TCPDUMP are:
1. Extract project3.tar.xz
2. Go to subdirectory: ./lightClient
3. run: sudo chmod u+x client.sh
4. run: touch <LOGFILE NAME>
5. Launch: ./client.sh <Server IP> <PORT> <LOGFILE NAME>

In Short steps to run w/out TCPDUMP are:
1. Extract project3.tar.xz
2. Go to subdirectory: ./lightClient
3. run: make
5. run: touch <LOGFILE NAME>
6. Launch: ./switch <Server IP> <PORT> <LOGFILE NAME>
