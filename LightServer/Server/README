This is a C++20 makefile project [DESIGNED FOR UNIX SYSTEMS ON A UNIX SYSTEM].
    server.cpp is the C++ part of the program which must be compiled first
    start.sh will compile and launch the C++ code along with TCPDUMP at the same time

To run simply invoke: ./start.sh <PORT> <LOGFILE-NAME>
NOTE: Couldn't get flag implementation to work, so please use arguments as shown above

NOTE2: Please create a file that is the name of your logfile supplied to the program. The program
    will look for a file by that name and exit if none found.

NOTE3: New input argument, <Run-Iterations>. If nothing is put here server will run indefinitely
    The user can enter a number of packets to recieve, after the limit is hit the server will exit gracefully
    Otherwise the only way to stop is [CTRL]+[C]

How to use:

Steps to run are:
1. Extract project1.tar.xz
2. run: sudo chmod u+x start.sh
4. run: touch <LOGFILE-NAME>
5. Launch: ./start.sh <PORT> <LOGFILE-NAME>
