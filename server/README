This zip folder contains:
1. program.cpp
2. logfile
3. makefile
4. client.sh
5. project1.pcap

REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES:
TCPDUMP
make
g++


This is a C++20 makefile project [DESIGNED FOR LINUX SYSTEMS]. To compile go to the working directory and type: make
    This will compile program.cpp which is the C++ part of this program
    client.sh will launch the C++ code along with TCPDUMP at the same time

To run simply invoke: ./client <Server IP> <PORT> <LOGFILE NAME>
NOTE: user may have to use sudo chmod u+x client.sh
NOTE2: Please create a file that is the name of your logfile supplied to the program. The program
    will look for a file by that name.

How to use:

Had to deviate from project specifications slightly as I could not figure out how to get my implementation of flags to work correctly, therefore use is:
./client.sh <Server IP> <PORT> <LOGFILE NAME>


In Short steps to run are:
1. Extract project1.tar.xz
2. run: sudo chmod u+x client.sh
3. run make: make
4. run: touch <LOGFILE NAME>
5. Launch: ./client.sh <Server IP> <PORT> <LOGFILE NAME>
